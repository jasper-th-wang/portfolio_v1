I spent my childhood peeking over my dad's shoulder as he stayed up and handcrafted numerous websites.

Fast forward a bit, a few years ago I picked up some JavasScript skills and hacked up a website when I was completing my bachelor's in psychology- I instantly fell in love with programming.

Now, I am currently pursuing computer science in British Columbia Institute of Technologyâ€™s Computer System Technology program. What's my drive? Simple: I love creating awesome stuff. Whether it's an app or a website, if it lets me problem-solve, I'm all in!
