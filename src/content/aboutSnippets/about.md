Hi! I am a software developer based in Vancouver, Canada. I am currently pursuing my second bachelor's in computer science at UBC. I have experience working with fullstack applications, infrastructure and DevOps.

I spent my childhood peeking over my dad’s shoulder as he stayed up creating websites as a web developer.

Fast forward a bit, I picked up some JavaScript skills and hacked up a website when I was completing my first bachelor’s in psychology- I instantly fell in love with programming.

And the rest is history.
